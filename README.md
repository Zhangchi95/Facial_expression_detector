# Facial_expression_detector
A pre-trained SSD neural network for the use of analyzing human emotions
This project is based on Single Shot Multibox Detector(SSD), the article is in https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325, the orignal SSD neural network is written in Caffe framework:https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe/tree/ssd, however in this design, what I used is the SSD in the tensorflow objection detection API:https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection which I think has a more comfortable input file format(TFRecord).
The training dataset we use is Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces (KDEF) which is a set of totally 4900 pictures of human facial expressions, and this set is also publicly available from http://kdef.se. However, I just randomly pick up 110 of them for training use, and I will enlarge my training set in the future.
There are several steps to do in the data preprocessing, First is label training set, what I use is LabelImg which is a convenient tool is able to label imgaes into xml file whcich contains coordinate of bounding box and class(PASCAL format). and using xml_2_csv script to transfer xml into csv which can be transfered into TFRecord, then using csv_2_tfrecord script to transfer csv into TFRecord which can be input into SSD.
